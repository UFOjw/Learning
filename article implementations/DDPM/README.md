Implementation of a probabilistic diffusion model.

To build this model, the basic UNET model with the Attention mechanism was used.
To train the model, we used a [Landscape Pictures](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnaud58/landscape-pictures) image dataset containing a variety of landscape images.
