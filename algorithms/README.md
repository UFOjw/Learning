# Algorithms Projects Collection

This repository contains four projects demonstrating classic machine learning algorithms, each implemented from scratch or with minimal external libraries. These projects are designed primarily for educational purposes and illustrate key principles behind popular algorithms.

## Included Projects

1. **Decision Tree Regressor**

   * Custom implementation of a decision tree for regression tasks.
   * Includes MSE-based node splitting and stopping criteria.
   * Supports tree visualization as JSON.

2. **Simple Neural Network (NumPy)**

   * Fully-connected neural network implemented with NumPy.
   * Demonstrates forward/backward propagation and manual gradient descent.
   * Suitable for understanding basics of deep learning.

3. **Gradient Boosting Regressor**

   * Custom gradient boosting regressor using decision trees (scikit-learn) as base learners.
   * Illustrates the ensemble method and gradient descent on loss functions.
   * Compatible with scikit-learn-style fit/predict interface.

4. **Naive Bayes Classifier**

   * Jupyter Notebook demonstrating Naive Bayes algorithm for classification.
   * Covers data preprocessing, model evaluation, and practical usage.
