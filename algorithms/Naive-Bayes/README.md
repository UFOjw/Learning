# Naive Bayes Classifier Project

## Overview

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation and evaluation of the Naive Bayes classification algorithm. Naive Bayes is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm based on Bayes' Theorem, often used in text classification and spam detection tasks.

## Key Features

* Introduction to the Naive Bayes classifier
* Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Implementation using scikit-learn
* Model evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## Requirements

To run the notebook, ensure the following Python packages are installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

You can use Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to open and run the file.

## Usage

This notebook serves educational purposes and can be used to understand the basic principles of the Naive Bayes classifier and its application on structured datasets.
